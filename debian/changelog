 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Thu,  9 Dec 2004 12:45:08 +0000

apt-spy (3.1-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * file.c: remove assumption of signedness of char when comparing to EOF.
    This had the effect of causing the thing to hang on powerpc.  Remove the
    cast altogether as getc() returns an int anyway.  (Closes: #282121)
  * Update README.mirrors.txt to October 26th version.

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Nov 2004 10:39:00 +0000

apt-spy (3.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

    but I appear to be in the minority.  (Closes: #277816)
  * rename README.mirrors.txt to mirrors.txt to make it look less like a
    documentation file.  (Closes: #278201)

apt-spy (3.1-10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Backing out the previous NMU of Martin's.
    apt-spy does not "dynamically update".  It updates *if and ONLY if*
    you ask it to.  I do not see this as a violation of the spirit of 
    the FHS.  I'm more than happy to have discussion about this.  PLEASE
    this time, let's have the discussion *BEFORE* the NMU!

apt-spy (3.1-9.1) unstable; urgency=medium
 
  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Moved the list of mirrors from /usr/share/apt-spy to /var/lib/apt-spy
    because it is dynamically updated and thus in violation of the FHS and
    hence the policy (closes: Bug#277816).

apt-spy (3.1-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * ARGH.  Not content with breaking shit once by changing the soname, he
    changes it back and breaks shit a second time.  Okay, it was all he
    could do I suppose.  Again, rebuild without changing anything at all to
    account for the soname change in libcurl.  (Closes: #252998)
  * Quote strings in debian/menu.  I may remove this in the future anyway.
    It makes no real sense to run apt-spy from a menu anyway since it
    *needs* command line options.  If anyone objects to this let me know,
    othrewise I'll remove it in a future version.
  * Bump standards version to 3.6.1

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Sun,  6 Jun 2004 15:16:09 +0100

apt-spy (3.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Rebuild for libcurl soname change.
  * Version -4 doesn't display the problem in #251887, not does this (-6)
    version.  There is nothing in the diff between -4 and -5 that would
    cause it.  I've not touched the source *at* *all* between -5 and -6.  I
    am therefore assuming that it was a fuckup in some library somewhere.
    I'm closing the bug, if the symptoms reappear, feel free to reopen it.
    (Closes: #251887)

  * parse area option case insensitively (Closes: #245794)

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Mon, 24 May 2004 15:11:32 +0000

apt-spy (3.1-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Because apt-spy uses curl timeouts to only download a portion of the
    file, the fact that ftp3.nrc.ca was silently dropping the connection on
    the floor meant that curl was giving a timeout, just like it would it it
    had downloaded part of the file.  Turns out that the values returned by
    curl_easy_getinfo() are undefined unless the connect actually happens
    and some data is transferred.  Steven Holmes prepared a patch which
    checks that some data actually has been transferred before using the
    values returned by curl_easy_getinfo().  This fixes the case where a
    server dropping the connection rather than rejecting it results in
    apt-spy reporting a infinite speed of transfer.  (Closes: #242840)
  * Updated README.mirrors.txt

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Tue, 13 Apr 2004 23:56:39 +0000

apt-spy (3.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * fixed off-by-one error in main.c.  Many thanks to Steven Holmes for
    finding and fixing this so quickly.  (Closes: 230044)

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jan 2004 00:37:18 +0000

apt-spy (3.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Steven Holmes provided -w option which allows the user to specify the
    number of top servers to output to a file.  (Closes: #211918)

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Mon, 12 Jan 2004 16:32:46 +0000

apt-spy (3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version fixing some bugs and adding a feature 
  * Fixes -o screwing up.  The patch for this came from Brian Warner
    <warner@lothar.com>.  I've also ensured that the orig.tar.gz does NOT
    include a copy of the executable.  The blame for this was mine since it
    was I (and not Steven Holmes) who ended up packing up the orig.tar.gz
    for v3.0.  Sorry about that.  (Closes: #221965)
  * Implements the ability (via the -s option) to specify a list of
    countries to benchmark rather than using whole continents.  The
    countries are specified using the ISO3166 two letter country code.  This
    is the same as the internet TLD in all but a very few corneer cases (the
    most notable corner case is the United kingdom, where .uk is the TLD,
    but GB is the ISO3166.  This has been special-cased and apt-spy should
    recognise both as valid).  Be aware that these ARE case sensitive, and
    should be entered in UPPER CASE. (Closes: #201594)
  * The manpage was updated to make it clearer that the -d option MUST be
    used unless you are updating the mirror list.  Hopefully this makes it
    less surprising for users.  (Closes: 223263)
  * Included the most up to date (currently) README.mirrors.txt, dated Oct 9
    2003.

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Thu, 18 Dec 2003 15:59:50 +0000

apt-spy (3.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * backed out the wgetting since not all buildds are promised to be
    connected to the internet.
  * We now check to make sure we aren't backing up a zero byte file.
    (Closes: #196330) Whilst I agree that appending (or more properly adding
    to the top of the file) the new sources is more robust, it's something
    that will NOT be added to 3.0.  I've just filed a wishlist bug against
    apt-spy for this feature, and it will probably be implemented in 3.1.

apt-spy (3.0-4) unstable; urgency=low

apt-spy (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch from Steven Holmes to fix writing of sources.list
    (Closes: #196330) -- NB: This patch hasn't had half the testing I would
    have liked...please test it to extinction :)
  * Modified manpage to use "-d distribution" rather than "-d dist" for the
    benefit of the hard of understanding :) (actually I CAN see how
    confusion could arise, especially since English may not be your
    preferred language, or if you were trying to very quickly read the
    manpage and just read the synopsis) (Closes: #194582)
  * Modified debian/rules so a clean (and current) mirror list is downloaded
    every build.

 -- Stephen Stafford <ssta@pol.ac.uk>  Tue, 17 Jun 2003 08:23:41 +0000

apt-spy (3.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * minor buggette.  If dist == stable the the security line is commented
    out, and if dist != stable the security line is uncommented.  This is
    the wrong way around.  changed line 252 of parse.c to be: 
    if (strcmp(dist, "stable") == 0)

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Thu, 22 May 2003 00:45:53 +0100

apt-spy (3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * All new source!  Total rewrite, so all new bugs to find! :)
  * New features in this version include:
    - Ability to only benchmark mirrors from a given geographical region
      (Pertains: #119918)
      This means (in part) that if you want to, you can define your very *own*
      "Primary mirror list" easily and quickly :) (Closes: #134538)
    - The -d <dist> option is now *required* before apt-spy will overwrite
      sources.list.  It proved entirely too difficult to parse the
      distribution to use from the existing list (many people have multiple
      distributions in there, and it's not easy to decide which to use), but
      it will now NOT overwrite your sources.list with the WRONG
      distribution (unless you are silly and tell it the wrong one :)
      (Closes: #119918)
    - This version no longer outputs an outdated version string.
      (Closes: #153755)
    - We no longer add outdated external repostories to sources.list
      (Closes: #193166)
    - setting -e 1 now will do the Right Thing (Closes: #165629)
    - No longer limited to a 10Mbit max throughput (Closes: #154546)
    - Totally different sourcetree shouldn't segfault (or at least, not in
      the same places :)  (Closes: #150205 #139220)
    - Should now deal with an edited mirrors.list (although defining your
      own "area" is more robust).  (Closes: #144311)
    - There are far more informative error messages if we have problems with
      retrieving either the mirror list during an update, or whilst
      benchmarking any of the servers.  There may be *similar* bugs to this
      one in 3.0, but the OLD bug has gone :) (Closes: #137001)
  * I would like to state, on record, my undying gratitude towards Steven
    Holmes, who wrote this version of apt-spy for me as a favour.  After
    Danny (who wrote v1.x and v2.x) became too busy with life to look after
    it, it was looking like I was going to have to ask for its removal (for
    chronic bugginess) since I certainly didn't have the time to do a full
    rewrite.  Steven stepped in, even though he is a BSD whore these days,
    and has done an utterly wonderful job of the rewrite. Thanks steg, I owe
    you a pint (well, two pints since I managed to get the BSD whore dig in :)

  * Comment call in sockets.c to update_status which meant wheel
    updated every byte.
    Huge thanks and kudos to Bernhard Link for the pointer.

  * This release (hopefully) fixes all the ftp proxying problems.
    (Closes: #102989, #116249, #119293)
  * Updated manpage to say that if no distribution is specified with
    -d switch that stable is the default.  (Relates: #119918)

 -- Colin Walters <walters@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Dec 2001 05:50:34 -0500

apt-spy (2.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied one character patch to sockets.c to fix ftp proxying
    support.  We need to pass the address, not the value to sscanf, so 
    s/port/&port/ in line 279.

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Oct 2001 19:55:17 +0100

apt-spy (2.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed kb for kB to make it clearer that the benchmark is in
    kiloBYTES rather than kiloBITS.  kB is no more a "correct" abbreviation
    of "kilobytes" than kb IMO.  But I agree that it might look clearer to
    some.  I personally have never heard of "kibibytes", and I do not think 
    that making the units "KiB" would make the meaning clearer to many people.  
    In fact to the majority of people I believe it would obscure meaning.  
    So I will not use "KiB" as units.  For the record 1kB for the purposes of 
    apt-spy is 1024 bytes and not 1000 bytes.  (Closes: #114646)

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Sat,  6 Oct 2001 15:48:33 +0100

apt-spy (2.2-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * applied patches to main.c and sockets.c from Danny Rodrigues
    to fix a divide by zero error on Alpha and an "interrupted
    system call" problem which affected all arches 
    (Closes: #114091, #114064)
  * 2.2-5.test was never realeased/uploaded.  I created it so that the
    sunmitter of #113400 could test some things to hopefully track down his
    bug.  It didn't track down the bug, but the changes are a Good Thing(tm)
    anyway.  So rather than updating every 128bytes while on, the wheel now
    updates only every 2kbytes (2048)

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Tue,  2 Oct 2001 20:31:04 +0100

apt-spy (2.2-5.test) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Sep 2001 23:14:49 +0100

apt-spy (2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches to main.c and main.h to fix the version which
    --help reports and to fix the way saving output to another file
    via the -l switch repoted erroneously that it was saving to
    sources.list (Closes: #113084)
  * Appears that it saves the file on some occasions even if it barfs
    with a network error.  Luckily it saves a backup, but it should not
    save a bad file at all.  Danny Rodriguez supplied a fixed main.c which
    should no longer do this.

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Sun, 23 Sep 2001 17:31:17 +0100

apt-spy (2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * patched to support (limited) ftp proxing using patch from Filipe Maia
    (Closes: #112447).  If anyone wants to extend this code to make it more
    generic, patches always appreciated.  Thank you for this Filipe.

 -- Stephen Stafford <bagpuss@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Sep 2001 01:29:38 +0100

apt-spy (2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
  * Hopefully the hanging problem is sorted out now, but as I
    have never been able to reliably reproduce it I am not 100%
    sure of this.  Hence I am leaving the bugs open for mow, but
    downgrading them to minor (I will close them in a few weeks).
  * the screen no longer gets cleared (Closes: #104467)
  * changed usage to refer to apt-spy instead of apt-sources.
    (Closes: #104470)
  * added horrible hack to debian/rules as the upstream clean targets
    do not appear to be doing what they are supposed to.
  * altered getopt.c so that the last character of a top scorers file
    should no longer be 0xFF (Closes: #105241)
